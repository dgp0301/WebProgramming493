I’ve been a computer science student for 3 years. In that time I feel like I have learned a ton but also haven’t learned anything at all. I feel like I have become proficient in Java but the more courses I take the more I see that that doesn’t matter. It was very apparent in software engineering. I took the course with Tony Denizard. It was a large scale project where there we had to build an application for an electronic health recording system. The catch was we couldn’t use any language we already knew. So in that class, I feel like I got used to learning new languages on the fly. I was mostly working on the backend for the project so I worked with PHP and some SQL through the wyvern servers. I dabbled with some HTML but just very basic form pages.
	In this class, I’m hoping to be able to easily create a decent looking web page on the fly because I feel it is a useful tool to have. Even in backend software engineering, it seems knowing HTML comes in handy as the back and front end seem to mesh a lot.
